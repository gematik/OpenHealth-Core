# Documentation Overview

This directory contains documentation for OpenHealth-Core, including interoperability notes and other project-specific guides.

## Interoperability

Interoperability-related notes live under `interop/`:

- [`JVM interoperability and debugging`](interop/jvm.md) – Debugging and interoperability notes for JVM targets (Java, Kotlin).

As additional documentation areas (e.g. architecture, APIs, deployment) are added under `docs/`, they should be organized into subdirectories and referenced from this overview.
