# Crypto Kotlin Multiplatform

Commonly used cryptographic algorithms within the context of the gematik.

## Status

Currently all api definitions are considered unstable.
As of now, the api is largely oriented on the one of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html).

The next stage will adjust the public api to be more in style of Kotlin.
