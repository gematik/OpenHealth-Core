# Repository Guidelines

## Code Style

We follow the official [Kotlin Style Guide](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html), enforced via [ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint) and [detekt](https://github.com/detekt/detekt).

Run these commands from the root directory to check or format the code:

```sh
# Check if the code complies with the style rules
./gradlew ktlintCheck
./gradlew detekt

# Automatically format all Kotlin code
./gradlew ktlintFormat
```

## Handling TODOs

**TODOs**: Always associate `TODO` comments with a ticket in the following format:

`// TODO OPEN-1234: Description of the task or acceptable workaround.`

This ensures proper tracking and management of open `TODOs`.
